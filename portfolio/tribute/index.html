					<p>Richard P. Feynman (<strong>°</strong> May 11, 1918
						<strong>†</strong> February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the fields of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium,
						as well as in particle physics. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.</p>

						<p>Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down
							nanotechnology called <em>There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom</em>, and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures,
							<em>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</em>. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books <em>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</em> and <em>What Do You Care What Other People Think?</em> and books written about him, such
							as <em>Tuva or Bust!</em> and <em>Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman</em> by James Gleick.</p>
							<h2><small>QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter</small></h2>
							<p>QED was designed to be a popular science book, written in a witty style, and containing just enough quantum-mechanical mathematics to allow the solving of very basic problems in quantum electrodynamics by an educated lay audience. It is
								unusual for a popular science book in the level of mathematical detail it goes into, actually allowing the reader to solve simple optics problems, as might be found in an actual textbook. But unlike in a typical textbook, the mathematics
								is taught in very simple terms, with no attempt to solve problems efficiently, use standard terminology, or facilitate further advancement in the field. The focus instead is on nurturing a basic conceptual understanding of what is really
								going on in such calculations.</p>
